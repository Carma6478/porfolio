<h2 style="margin-top:-125px">Story:</h2><td>I'm a Graduating Student in <b>Computer Engineering at De La Salle Araneta University</b>, during my Senior High School i was a student at <b>University of the East Caloocan</b> and the Strand that I took was General academic Strand eventhough I can apply in STEM strand, and I took GAS strand due to the reason that I dont really know what I will be taking in college. Eventhough I was from General Academic Strand, it was easy for me to understand the lessons during my first year on Computer Engineering, thats why I continued and aim for scholarship in the University that I was in. I was also a <b>Consistent Deans Lister for 6 terms out of 10 terms</b> while I taking Computer Engineering. i was also a 3 
years member of LACES or La Salle Araneta Computer Engineering Society where I served as a Public Relation Officer or PRO, President of the Organization and lastly as a 4th year Representative who guides the new officers of the organization. We conducted Several 
Seminars in our organization. Here are some of the Seminars that We conducted during my term as the president of the Organization,"Be Ready, Your Turn: A Tech-Career Webinar", "The Importance of Dependable IT Security Operations in Business Organization", "Application Development and Business Analytics", Industrial Internet of Things in the Manufacturing Sector", and many more.
